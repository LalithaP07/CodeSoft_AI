ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Chatbot with Rule-Based Responses
Description:
Developed a simple chatbot that interacts with users through predefined rule-based responses. Implemented using basic if-else conditions and pattern matching to simulate conversation flow. This task introduced me to fundamental natural language processing (NLP) concepts.

ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe AI
Description:
Built an AI player for the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm, ensuring unbeatable gameplay. This project deepened my understanding of game theory, decision trees, and adversarial search algorithms.

ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Image Captioning
Description:
Created a model that generates captions for images by combining computer vision and NLP techniques. Utilized pre-trained CNNs (like VGG16/ResNet) to extract image features and an RNN/Transformer-based model for sequence generation. This task highlights the intersection of deep learning across vision and text domains.

ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Recommendation System
Description:
Implemented a basic recommendation engine using content-based filtering. It suggests items like movies based on user preferences and item descriptions, applying techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity to generate relevant suggestions.

ðŸ”¹ Task 5: Face Detection and Recognition
Description:
Developed an application capable of detecting and recognizing faces in images or video streams. Used pre-trained models such as Haar cascades for face detection, with optional implementation of face recognition using deep learning techniques like Siamese networks or ArcFace.
